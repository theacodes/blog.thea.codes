Hello folks,

So... I'm transgender. I'm leaving behind my old name and pronouns and finally choosing a name that really resonates with me.

My name is *Thea Flowers*.

I know that it takes some time for everyone to adjust - mistakes will be forgiven. As long as you're not malicious or calling me my old name 2 years from now we're cool. :)

I am so excited about this next chapter of my life and I am so thankful for all of my wonderful and supportive friends.
